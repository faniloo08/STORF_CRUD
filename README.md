#STORF Patient Management System
React.js
Axios
MariaDB
SQL
A lightweight web application designed to manage patient records and appointment schedules for the hospital's Traumatology, Orthopedics, and Functional Rehabilitation Service (STORF).


#Project Overview
STORF Patient Management System is a personal project developed to assist the secretarial team of the Service de Traumatologie, d&aposOrthopédie et de Rééducation Fonctionnelle (STORF) in a hospital environment. The application streamlines patient record management and helps avoid manual entry errors, improving the overall efficiency of daily administrative tasks.


#Key Features
- CRUD Operations:
Allows creation, modification, viewing, and deletion of patient records, particularly focusing on correct hospital file numbers.
- Extended Information Storage:
Includes fields for address, medical diagnosis, contact phone numbers, and next appointment dates (currently being expanded).
- Practical Utility:
Designed with real-world usability in mind, favoring functionality over aesthetic complexity.


#Technical Approach

- Frontend Development: Built using React.js, providing a responsive and simple user interface.
- API Communication: Axios library is used for making efficient API calls to the database.
- Database Management: MariaDB (SQL-based) serves as the backend to store all patient-related information securely.


My Role
I handled the entire development of the project, from setting up the database schema and server-side communication to frontend interface design. I also provided real-world deployment and maintenance to ensure the application could be effectively used by the hospital staff.
